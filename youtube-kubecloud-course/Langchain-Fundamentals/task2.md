# ⏰ Task 2: Multi-Model A/B Testing (2 minutes)

📚 What is Multi-Model Support?

Definition: The ability to switch between AI providers (OpenAI, Google, X.AI) using the same code interface - no rewrites needed!

Think of it like USB ports - same interface, different devices. LangChain is your universal adapter for AI models.
🎯 The Real-World Problem

Your boss: "We're spending $50K/month on OpenAI. Can we use something cheaper?"

You: "Give me 2 minutes. I'll test 3 providers right now!"
🔥 What You'll Test:

    OpenAI GPT-4: The industry standard ($$$)
    Google Gemini: 3x cheaper, just as good? ($$)
    X.AI Grok: 2x faster responses ($)

💰 Pro Tip: Companies save 40% on average by finding the right model mix. Some use GPT-4 for complex tasks, Gemini for simple queries!
