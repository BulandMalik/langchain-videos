# ⏰ Task 1: Zero-Shot Prompting (2 minutes)

📚 What is Zero-Shot Prompting?

Definition: Asking AI to perform tasks without providing examples - like asking a chef to cook without showing them a recipe.

The AI relies entirely on its pre-trained knowledge and your instructions.
❌ The Problem with Vague Prompts:

"write a policy"  // Too vague!
// Result: Generic 1000-word essay about policies in general

✅ The Power of Specific Prompts:

"Write a 200-word GDPR-compliant data privacy policy
for European customers with 30-day retention period"

💡 Real Impact: Anthropic found that specific zero-shot prompts improved response accuracy by 73% over vague requests!
