# ⏰ Task 2: One-Shot Prompting (2 minutes)

📚 What is One-Shot Prompting?

Definition: Providing one example for the AI to follow - like showing a chef one dish before asking them to cook something similar.

The AI learns your format, style, and structure from a single example.
✨ The Magic of Examples:

Show the AI your company's policy format once, and it will replicate it perfectly for new policies!

Example: REFUND POLICY with 5 numbered sections
Result: REMOTE WORK POLICY with same 5 sections!

💰 Pro Tip: Amazon uses one-shot prompting for product descriptions - one example ensures thousands of listings follow the same format!
