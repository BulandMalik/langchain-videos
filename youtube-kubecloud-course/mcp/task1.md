# 📡 Task 1: Understanding MCP Basics

🎯 Create Your First MCP Server

📁 Select task_1_mcp_basics.py from the explorer

✏️ Complete the TODOs:

    Line 65: Initialize FastMCP server: "Calculator"
    Line 78: Add tool decorator: @mcp.tool()

💡 Key Learning: MCP servers expose tools via decorators, tools are tested directly, production servers run with mcp.run()

🚀 Run Command (Terminal 1)
`python3 /root/code/task_1_mcp_basics.py`

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Server Runs Continuously

After running the command above, the MCP server will start and run continuously. This is normal behavior for MCP servers!

    ✅ Keep Terminal 1 open - The server must stay running
    ✅ You'll see "Server ready! Waiting for client connections..."
    ✅ Task 1 is marked complete automatically before server starts
    ✅ Open a new terminal (Terminal 2) for the next tasks
    ❌ Don't press Ctrl+C until you finish all MCP tasks
