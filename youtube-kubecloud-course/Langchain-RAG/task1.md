# 🎯 Understanding Task 1: Foundation for RAG
What You're Building:

    ChromaDB Client: Your vector database to store document embeddings
    Collection: A named container for organizing your TechCorp documents
    Embedding Model: Converts text into 384-dimensional vectors for semantic understanding

🔑 Key Concept: This creates the infrastructure that RAG needs to store and retrieve document chunks based on meaning, not just keywords. Think of it as building the "brain's memory" where your AI will search for answers!
